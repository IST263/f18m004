Couple of things to keep in mind

* You can submit aka commit your work as often as you want. 
* I encourage you to commit your work everytime you work on it even if you have  partially finished it. 
* Committing code onto GitHub will ensure that there is a backup of your work
* Git will ONLY track your work that is done in the course folder you have setup

## Submitting/Committing your homework 


I assume you have done and saved your work in the class folder. Follow these steps everytime you want to commit your work.


1. Launch the GitHub desktop client. 
2. On a Windows PC it should look something like the pic below.

    * Make sure the correct repo is selected (topmost arrow)
    * 'Changes' will list all the files that have been changed since the last commit.       
    
3. Enter a meaningful commit message - this is to help you remember what you have completed so far. Only you and the instructor will be able see this.

4. Click 'Commit to Master'. You will also notice that in the 'Changes' box it will read '0 changed files'. 

5. Now we can upload the files to GitHub. Click 'Push Origin'.

6. Congratuations you just committed your work to GitHub.

## How to check if homework has been submitted

Below are some of the ways you can check to make sure the homework has been successfully submitted.

### Check via GitHub.com
1. Login to GitHub at [https://github.com](https://github.com) 
2. Once you've logged in, look for 'Your Repositories' in the page and click on your 'IST263' repository.
3. Clicking on the repo will bring you to the repo details page. Click on the 'Commits' tab to see when the latest commit was made.


### Check on GitHub desktop application  
Launch your GitHub desktop application, select your repository from the list. Then click on 'History' to see your commit history. The latest commit should show in there.


### Commit Email

I have setup a custom notification to email me and you (the person submitting the homework) when a commit is posted. This should be instantaneous and mostly reliable.


## Pulling homework feedback & points
    The instructor has cloned every student's course folder on his workstation as well. That allows him to view and evaluate your committed work. After the homework is evaluated he will add notes/comments to your file(s) and assign the homework points. 

Follow these steps to pull the homework points & feedback

1. Launch the GitHub desktop client. 

2. On a Windows PC it should look something like the pic below.

3. Click 'Pull Origin' or 'Sync' (if you are on a Mac)

4. Click on 'History' tab to see that changes posted by the Instructor have been downloaded.

5. Open the course folder in your file browser and look for a file 'grade.txt' in the week's folder. 

6. If the due date hasn't passed you can revise the homework and resubmit.
