In this class you will use tools and workflows that web developers use in the industry. Also, it is a lot more efficient
than using the typical LMS. It will seem foreign when you start but be a little persistant.


## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

If you have used programs like MS-Word, you have used an IDE. IDEs are specialized programs that provide features and tools that make your development process efficient. Just like you would use MS-Word to write and format papers, resumes, or letters we will use something similar in this class to write HTML, CSS and some Javascript.

## Git & GitHub

These are 2 different tools - don't let the names confuse you. Below is a brief explanation of what they are 

### git

git is a program that you install on **your computer** which can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. It is a version control system primarily used in software development. You might have used the 'Track Changes' feature in MS-Word - git does all that and lot more.


### GitHub

GitHub is a web-based git. It complements git in ways that makes it possible for multiple people to work on a single project simultaneously. It also provides a way to store your code remotely.
